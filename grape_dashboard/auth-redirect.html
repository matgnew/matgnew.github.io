  MSAL popup redirect handler.
  This page must be hosted at the same domain as the dashboard.
  Its URL must be registered as the Redirect URI in Azure Portal
  (App Registration → Authentication → Single-page application).

  No script needed here. MSAL's loginPopup() in the parent window
  monitors the popup's URL. The moment the popup lands on this
  registered redirect URI (with the auth code in the URL hash),
  MSAL intercepts it, extracts the token, resolves the promise,
  and closes the popup automatically.
